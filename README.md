IPMail
======

Auto send mail to administer when server reboot.

You may have a sever at home with dymanic IP.

When it encounter reboot,  it may get different IP.

In such case,  we will disconnect with server.

I try to write a simple script.

It run when server boot.

The function of the script are get IP and send a mail to administer, then you can reconnect with server.
